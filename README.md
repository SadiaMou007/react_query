# React Query

## 1

Client data could be stored using - useState, useReducer hook or third party state management library like redux or mobx.Redux or MobX work fine, but they often introduce more problems by treating server state the same as client state and using a global store.

### Client State:

- Ephemeral - It goes away when the browser is closed.
- Synchronous - It's instantly available.
- Client owned - Stayed in the browser that creates it.

### Server State:

- Stored remotely - The client has no control over what is stored or how it is stored.
  Asynchronous
- It takes a bit of time for the data to come from the server to the client(network request: send - process - response back).
- Owned by many users - Multiple users could change the data.

### How React Query Solves Server State.

- Import the useQuery hook to make request
- Include a unique key to identify this query
- Access query.isError, query.error.message, query.isLoading, query.isFetching, and query.data to get the state of our request
- Call the refetch method on the query object to get new data
